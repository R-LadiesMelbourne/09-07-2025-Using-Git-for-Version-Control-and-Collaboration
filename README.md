# 09-07-2025-Using-Git-for-Version-Control-and-Collaboration

This presentation gave an introduction to Git, the basics of how to use it, and some of its very helpful applications such as collaboration and code reproducibility. The focus was on the use of Git in conjunction with Github (yes, these are two separate things!). Helping you to effectively use one of the most powerful tools available to you and give you more confidence to code freely without fear.

**📅 This meetup was held on the 9th of July at DiUS offices, Melbourne.**
